EBCoin is an ERC20 token standardized on Ethereum blockchain, and a complete eWallet solution. By using EBCoin, consumers receive their refunds instantaneously and can then use their proceeds as a digital currency. With EBCoin, tax refunds are transparent, resulting in greater efficiencies for tax authorities. For retailers, EBCoin significantly reduces costs relative to the incumbent systems. EBCoin will drive higher tourism spend at participating duty free shops, and ultimately, the EBCoin itself becomes a store of value and payment. EBCoin is a registered Singaporean company and is advised by RHTLaw Taylor Wessing LLP, a global legal and advisory firm with representation across 41 offices in Asia, the Middle East, Europe and the United States via the Taylor Wessing network and ASEAM Plus Group.", "category": "Software Tourism ", "website": "https://t.me/joinchat/GMyFeQ-v98gyMY72g_-iUw", "whitepaper": "https://www.ebcoin.io/docs/EBCoin_Whitepaper_EN.pdf", "twitter": "https://twitter.com/EBCoinGlobal", "telegram": "", "slack": "https://ebcoin.slack.com/", "team": ["https://www.linkedin.com/in/joon-hun-kim-aa677359/", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/dustin-kim-161984153", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-king-464b02151/", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruce-yang-99855513a", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/ki-park-79a94b134/", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/chohee-byeon", "http://www.linkedin.com/in/sujinjo", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yongsun-yang-30299ab8/", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/liqian0315/"], "amt_raised": "", "soft_cap": "\n8,000 ETH\n", "hard_cap": "\n125,000 ETH\n", "pre_sale_date": "", "token_sale_date": "2018-01-09 - 2018-01-30", "total_supply": "", "country": "\nSingapore\n", "tokentype": "\nEthereum\n", "timestamp": 1515470143.0}, "gimmer": {"name": "Gimmer", "description": "Gimmer offers easy-to-use advanced algorithmic trading bots that require no programming skills, no previous trading experience and no in-depth knowledge of cryptocurrencies.

By cutting out the middleman, we can provide rewards which have real-world economic value to parents. We work directly with selected producers and brands, eliminate all unnecessary markups, and pass the savings on to parents. For parents who make a purchase, the rewards they receive can vary from between 5% to 40% of the cost of purchase. Parents can spend their rewards on the FamilyPoints platform to buy different kinds of services, from access to educational videos, to classes, and even insurance or family holidays which are focused on children and parents. Parents may even have the option to convert their rewards to cash in the future. The platform currently offers educational services that include online courses, live consultations with experts (beta version), access to the biggest parenting library in the world with 1,150 educational videos, webinars, and booking for offline classes centers. For customers, this means that FamilyPoints can also provide educational services and satisfy the needs of parents and children. We encourage customers to post content and provide feedback about the products and services we offer on FamilyPoints. Other users can then upvote helpful content and reviews with points (similar to Steem.it\u2019s service). Not only does this create a sense of community, but it also lets honest reviews do the marketing rather than paid promotions.", "category": "Retail Education ", "website": "https://t.me/familypointstoken", "whitepaper": "https://familypointsio.r.worldssl.net/pdf/whitepaper.pdf", "twitter": "https://twitter.com/points_family", "telegram": "", "slack": "", "team": [" https://www.linkedin.com/in/babystep/", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/aloykee/", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yangshaoming/", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikhail-konoplev-26359324/", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitriy-lezhnev-a674027b", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-rivas-780638100", "https://cn.linkedin.com/in/isolovyev", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-jeong-18130093/", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-panfilov-02408543/", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/svetlana-kolesnikova-45862712/", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonia-sharma-22b58a13/"], "amt_raised": "", "soft_cap": "\n3,000,000 USD\n", "hard_cap": "\n25,000,000USD\n", "pre_sale_date": "", "token_sale_date": "2018-02-21 - 2018-02-27", "total_supply": "", "country": "", "tokentype": "\nEthereum\n", "timestamp": 1515470143.0}, "juryonline": {"name": "Jury.Online", "description": "Jury.online enables users to make deals that, if any party is dissatisfied, are reviewed by a panel of jurors that deliver a judgement in favour of one of the parties.

These Celsius profiles are dynamic and change according to the users\u2019 history on the platform. The platform then proceeds to match borrowers with lenders by determining borrower credit limits and interest rates with accepting lenders. Smart technology is then used to bind the lender-borrower relationship. Borrowers\u2019 metrics are ascertained using the Celsius score - a digital credit score calculated using various metrics such as FICO scores, mortgage histories as well as non-traditional ones such as Uber and Amazon transaction histories. The Celsius platform serves lenders by allowing them to decide who they will extend credit to using borrowers\u2019 Celsius scores to determine their risk threshold. The decentralized lending platform hands the power of financial responsibility back to the general public by taking it away from the behemoth banks. Celsius helps build a trusted community, the success of which is pegged to the success of the Network itself.
